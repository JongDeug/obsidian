Runtime과 Compile time을 까먹음.

### 문제 해결

Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable code while the run time is the time at which the executable code is started running. Both the compile-time and runtime refer to different types of error.

**compile time은 executable code(실행 가능한 코드)로 바뀔 때를 말하고**

**runtime은 excutable code가 실행되었을 때를 말함.**
